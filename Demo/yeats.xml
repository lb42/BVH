<head>No Second Troy</head>
<head>by William Butler Yeats</head>

  

<l>Why should I blame her that sh<a>e fill</a>ed my days</l>
<l>With misery, or that she would of late</l>
<l>Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,</l>
<l>Or hurled the little streets upon the great.</l>
<l>Had they but courage equal to desire?</l>
<l>What could have made her peaceful with a mind</l>
<l>That nobleness made simple as a fire,</l>
<l>With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind</l>
<l>That is not natural in an age like this,</l>
<l>Being high and solitary and most stern?</l>
<l>Why, what could she have done, being what she is?</l>
<l>Was there another Troy for her to burn?</l>
