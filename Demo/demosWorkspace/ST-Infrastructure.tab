Note	VB
that	IN

For	IN

Because	IN

all	DT

To	TO

In	IN

the	DT

the	DT

In	IN

These	DT

the	DT

If	IN

For	IN

such	JJ

Although	IN

the	DT

a	DT

unless	IN
some	DT

since	IN
element	NN

Classes	NNS

not	RB

The	DT

therefore	RB
contain	VB
different	JJ
members	NNS

depending	VBG

which	WDT

Consequently	RB
,	,
the	DT
content	NN
model	NN
of	IN
a	DT

(	-LRB-

Some	DT

even	RB
when	WRB
all	DT

One	CD
reason	NN
for	IN
declaring	VBG
such	PDT
a	DT

is	VBZ
to	TO
make	VB
it	PRP
easier	JJR
for	IN
a	DT

to	TO
add	VB
new	JJ

elements	NNS
in	IN
a	DT

particularly	RB
in	IN
areas	NNS
where	WRB
the	DT
TEI	NNP
does	VBZ
not	RB
make	VB
fully	RB
elaborated	VBN
proposals	NNS

For	IN
example	NN
,	,
the	DT
TEI	NNP
class	NN
model.rdgLike	NN
,	,
initially	RB
empty	JJ
,	,
is	VBZ
expanded	VBN
by	IN
the	DT
textcrit	NN

to	TO
include	VB
just	RB
the	DT
TEI	NNP
rdg	NN

A	DT
project	NN
wishing	VBG
to	TO
add	VB
an	DT
alternative	JJ
way	NN
of	IN
structuring	VBG
text-critical	JJ
information	NN
could	MD
do	VB
so	RB
by	IN
defining	VBG
their	PRP$
own	JJ
elements	NNS
and	CC
adding	VBG
it	PRP
to	TO
this	DT
class	NN

Another	DT
reason	NN
for	IN
declaring	VBG
single-member	JJ
classes	NNS
is	VBZ
where	WRB
the	DT
class	NN
members	NNS
are	VBP
not	RB
needed	VBN
in	IN
all	DT

,	,
but	CC

in	IN
the	DT
same	JJ
place	NN
as	IN
elements	NNS
which	WDT

very	RB
frequently	RB
required	VBN

For	IN
example	NN

the	DT
specialized	JJ
element	NN
g	NN
used	VBN
to	TO
represent	VB
a	DT
non-Unicode	JJ
character	NN

the	DT
only	JJ
member	NN

the	DT
model.gLike	NN
class	NN
when	WRB
the	DT
gaiji	NN
module	NN

a	DT

References	NNS
to	TO
this	DT
class	NN
are	VBP
included	VBN
in	IN
almost	RB
every	DT
content	NN
model	NN
,	,
since	IN
if	IN
it	PRP
is	VBZ
used	VBN
at	IN
all	PDT
the	DT
g	NN
must	MD
be	VB
available	JJ
wherever	WRB
text	NN

;	:
however	RB
these	DT
references	NNS
have	VBP
no	DT
effect	NN
unless	IN
the	DT
gaiji	NN
module	NN
is	VBZ
loaded	VBN
.	.
At	IN
the	DT
other	JJ
end	NN
of	IN
the	DT
scale	NN
,	,
a	DT
few	JJ
of	IN
the	DT
classes	NNS
predefined	VBN
by	IN
the	DT
tei	NN
module	NN
are	VBP
subsequently	RB
populated	VBN
with	IN
very	RB
many	JJ
members	NNS
.	.
For	IN
example	NN
,	,
the	DT
class	NN
model.pPart.edit	NN
groups	NNS
all	PDT
the	DT
classes	NNS
of	IN
element	NN
for	IN
simple	JJ
editorial	NN
correction	NN
and	CC
transcription	NN
which	WDT
can	MD
appear	VB
within	IN
a	DT
p	NN
or	CC
paragraph	NN
element	NN
.	.
The	DT
core	NN
module	NN
alone	RB
adds	VBZ
more	JJR
than	IN
fifty	CD
elements	NNS
to	TO
this	DT
class	NN
;	:
the	DT
namesdates	NNS
module	NN
adds	VBZ
another	DT
twenty	CD
,	,
as	RB
does	VBZ
the	DT
tagdocs	NNS
module	NN

Since	IN
the	DT

one	CD
of	IN
the	DT
basic	JJ
building	NN
blocks	NNS
of	IN
a	DT
TEI	NNP

it	PRP

not	RB
surprising	JJ
that	IN
each	DT

need	VB

add	VB
elements	NNS
to	TO
it	PRP
.	.
The	DT
class	NN
system	NN
here	RB
provides	VBZ
a	DT
very	RB
convenient	JJ
way	NN
of	IN
controlling	VBG
the	DT

Typically	RB

Just	RB

These	DT

therefore	RB
do	VBP
